This directory is for the output of error correcting the Nanopore reads with proovread using either Illumina short reads, or short fragments generated from the nanopore reads themselves. 

The reason this is not part of the main pipeline is that that is designed to operate directly on, and only with, Nanopore data without requiring any external other datasets.
