The position weight matricies in this directory were generated by the publiction "Comprehensive splice-site analysis using comparative genomics", Sheth et. al. 2006, NAR, DOI:10.1093/nar/gkl556. 

The matricies are sspecies specific for the five species used in the study (human, mouse, fruitfly, c elegans and arabidopsis thaliana). They were downloaded directly from this site:
http://katahdin.mssm.edu/splice/splice_matrix_poster.cgi?database=spliceNew

They are provided here for use with the DRS pipeline. In theory any user specfied pwms should be usable witht he pipeline provided they follow the same format as the text files in this directory.
